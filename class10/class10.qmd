# The PDB database

The main repository for biomolecular data is called the PDB (Protein Data Bank) and can be found at: https://www.rcsb.org

Let's see what it contains in terms of type of molecule and method of structure determination (Analyze > PDB Stats > By Mol Type and Method)

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.


```{r}
nocomma <-  sub(",", "", pdbstats$X.ray)
sum( as.numeric( nocomma ) )
```
Let's try the **readr** package and it's newer `read_csv()` function.

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

The resulting columnames are "untidy" with spaces and a mix of upper and lower case leters that will make working with the colums a pain. We can use the **janitor** package and it's `clean_names()` function to fix this for us.

```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```
```{r}
library(janitor)
df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
```

Percent of structures in PDB solved by X-ray?
```{r}
n.xray <- sum(df$x_ray)
n.total <- sum(df$total)
n.xray
n.total
```

In UniProt there are 253,206,171 protein sequences and there are only 231,029 known structures in the PDB. This is a tiny fraction!!

```{r}
231029/ 253206171 * 100
```
Next day we will see how bioinformatics methods can help predict structure from sequence with accuracy approaching X-ray methods.

```{r}
n.xray/n.total * 100
```
Percent of EM structures?

```{r}
round(sum(df$em)/n.total * 100, 2)
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein? 

```{r}
round(df$total[1]/n.total * 100, digits=2)
```

## 2. Molecular visualization with Mol*

Mol-star is a new online structure viewer that is taking over the world of biomolecular visualization. Let's see how to use it from https://molstar.org/viewer/

My first image from Mol* of HIV-Pr

![Fig 1. A first view of the HIV-Pr dimer](1HSG.png)

I want an image that shows the binding cleft for the MK1 inhibitor, an image of the most valuable water in human history, and an image showing the catalytic ASP amino-acids.

![Binding cleft](1HSG-n.png)

![Ligand MK1 fit to cleft](1HSG-2.png)

![Water 308 and the two ASP 25 residues](1HSG-3.png)

![Overview with HOH 308 and ASP25 highlighted](1HSG-4.png)

## 3. Using the Bio3D package

This package has tones of tools and utilities for structural bioinformatics.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv
```

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```
```{r}
s <- pdbseq(hiv)
head(s)
```
>Q. How long is this sequence / how many amino-acids are in the structure

```{r}
length(s)
```

## Predict functional motions 

Let's read a new structure "6s36"

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("6s36")
pdb
```

We can run a NMA calculation on this structure:

```{r}
m <- nma(pdb)
plot(m, sse=pdb)
```

We can write out a wee trajectory of the predicted dynamics using the `mktrj()` function:

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="results.pdb")
```

## Comparative analysis

```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
aa
```

Search the PDB database for related sequences
```{r, blastsearch}
#| cache: true
blast <- blast.pdb(aa)
```

```{r}
hits <- plot(blast)
```

```{r}
head(blast$raw)
```


```{r}
hits$pdb.id
```

Download all these structures to our project dir

```{r}
# Download related PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

## Align and supperpose

```{r}
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```

## PCA our old friend
```{r}
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

```{r}
plot(pc.xray, pc.axes = c(1,2))
```

We can view the main PC1 captured displacements  with the mktrj function again:
```{r}
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
